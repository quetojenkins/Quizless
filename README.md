# Quizing
Once a quiz is selected, you will enter the quiz screen. A random card will be selected from the quiz. Flip between the question and answer using space/f or by clicking the flip button. Click correct or press c/> if you got the question right, your score will increase by one and that question will not come up again.

You can leave early by pressing done.

Press "q" to quit quizless.

# Creating a quiz
\*\* Currently the quiz folders are a bit funky. This will be resolved soon with a planned nested folder selection in the dropdown. The quizes are taken from the "sll" folder so just add your quiz there and it will come up in the dropdown \*\*

Quizes are read from text files and the text files are located in the File Handling folder. 

## Quiz Format
The standard format for all quizes are as follows:

\#\
\<Question\>\
\<Answer\>\
\#

## Special characters
"|" - this will add a new line in the flash card
"~" - this creates a bullet by replacing it with "\nâ€¢ " when printing to the flash card

## File Errors
\*\* more file error handling is planned to be built in the near future to make creators aware of where the errors are in thier files. use the current quizes as refernce for now \*\*

1. Dont leave any extra empty lines at the end of the file [this may be fixed soon]
2. Make sure that all questions have a corresponding answer below it.
3. Only use one "#" between questions and answers.
4. Questions and answers must only be on one line each. New lines can be added with "|"

# Why Quizless
The creators were tired of using online flash cards that require you to enter each question and answer individually which takes more time than the flashcards are worth. By storing the quizes as a text file with a standard format, notes/documents can be copied and pasted into a text file and with some formating you can have a 200 question quiz in no time. Saving quizes as text files also allows you to take school documents and format them into a quizless quiz by using basic string handling in a python script.
