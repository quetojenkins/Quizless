#
What is a benchmark in the computing world.
program that quantitatively evaluates performance, cost, and computing resources (among other things) of a  computing solution
#
What is a benchmarking suite?
set of benchmarks designed to give a comprehensive view of the performance of a computer system
#
Why does the selection of sofware and hardware impact final profit?
~cause no money is wasted on unused features of already bought hardware / software~development cheaper and faster with good tools~final product reliable and maintainable (less money spent maintaining)
#
What is the golden measure (in general and in computing)?
general = not perfect test, but the best available one that has a standard with known results||computing = a solution that may run slowly, isn’t optimized, but you know it gives (numerically speaking excellent results
#
How do you use wall clock time to benchmark a program?
start timer at start of execution and end timer at the end of execution
#
Name the standad C library used to measure wall clock time.
gettimeofday
#
Why does wall clock time suck (sometimes) ?
doesn’t give a full impression of how the system performed||Things it doesnt consider:~accuracy~development effort vs speed improvement~resource costs to get to new speed~power usage~maintainability~environmental impact
#
What are the "physical" compoents we should be targeting when benchmarking?
~compiler = converts high level to low -> need to benchmark its efficiency~processor = code in hand-crafted assembly so all comparisons are fair~OS = interrupt latencies / overhead / device limits / kernel size / availability of service~platform = saleability of memory / peripheral limits / interfaces supported / power~application#
#
What are the measurands when benchmarking?
~cycle count~data & program memory usage~execution time~power consumption
#
What is a code review and what does it entail?
practice (e.g. meeting or regular team-link up) of reviewing code developed for a project|~Unit testing~Function testing~Integration testing~How can this be improved
