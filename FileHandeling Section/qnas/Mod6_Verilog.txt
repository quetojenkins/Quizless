#
What are the benefits of a programmable chip?
~It can be used for many purposes including prototyping and final product~It has a low starting cost~ there is risk reduction~ increases turn around time
#
WHat are the types of porgrammable chips? List them from simpla and cheap to complex and expensive.
PLAs, CPLDs and FPGAs
#
How is the size of a PLD (programmable logic device) measured?
It is measured in the number of Logic Elements (LE's) that it contains.
#
What is a Programmable Logic Block (PLB)?
It contains manny programabble Logic Elements (PLE's).
