What are programmable chips?
A programmable chip can be configured according to the users needs. This means the same chip can be used for a variety of purposes.
#
What are the benefits of a programmable chip?
~It can be used for many purposes including prototyping and final product~It has a low starting cost~ there is risk reduction~ increases turn around time
#
WHat are the types of porgrammable chips? List them from simpla and cheap to complex and expensive.
PLAs, CPLDs and FPGAs
#
How is the size of a PLD (programmable logic device) measured?
It is measured in the number of Logic Elements (LE's) that it contains.
#
What is a Programmable Logic Block (PLB)?
It contains manny programabble Logic Elements (PLE's).
#
Draw a diagram to represent the Internal Structure of an FPGA.

What is the PLD/FPGA Development Flow? 
!FileHandeling Section/pictures/IMG_0484.jpg
#
Where is most of the development time of FPGA's spent?
In terms of the engineers time: In the Design and RTL Coding or the Timing Analysis| In terms of the PC's time: in the Place and Route
#
What are the four essential ingredients in Verilog Coding?
1. Modules| 2. Ports|3. Wires|4. Registers
#
What is a Module in Verilog Coding?
A module is the basic clock that does something and is connected to another. Modules are hierachical meaning they can be individual elements of composed of other modules.
#
What is the syntax for creating a module in Verilog?
module<module name>(<port names>);|...|endmodule
#
What are module ports?
A port is an interface used to move signals into or out of a module. You would declare these in the port names section in creating a module.
#
What are the wires?
They are used to connect elements, such as different ports of modules. Wires have values that are continously driven onto them.
#
How would you define a wire in a circuit?
wire a;
#
What is a register?
A register stores data until another value is put into them. It doesnt need a continous driver.
#
How do you declare a new register?
reg thisIsMyNewRegisterThatIAmDeclaring; // it defaults to 1 benefits
#
How do you change the value or set the value in a register?
thisIsMyNewRegisterThatIAmDeclaring = 1'b1; //this sets the value to 1
#
What are the different levels of abstraction is Verilog? List from lowest to highest level
1. Switch Level| 2. Gate Level|3. Data Flow Level|4. Behavioural Level
#
What does the Switch Level Abstraction mean?
This means Verilog is only implemented using switches and interconnects. This is the lowest level of abstraction.
