How do microcontrollers and microporcessors interact with a larger system and an external system?
Through wired or wireless communication interfaces.
#
How does a parallel communication interface work?
Parallel sends multiple bits of data in one go on separate lines.
#
Draw a diagram that illustrates the principle differences between serial and parallel interfaces.

#
What is Endianness?
It is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory.
#
What is the Big Endian?
The MSB of a word is stored at the smallest memory address. Thuis it is sent first in a communication.
#
What is Little Endian?
The MSB is stored at the largest memory address. It is sent last in a communication.
#
What does Asynchronous mean?
The communication does not have a seperate clock to indicate when actions or desicions should occur. This means data can be transmitted intermitently.
#
How would asynchronous communication work?
Both devices agree on how long it takes to transmit a bit.
#
What does Synchronous mean?
A seperate clock signal is ncorporated into the code and is used to indicate when desicions occur. No start or stop bits are required.
#
How does sampling on an edge work?
An action regards a occurs on a clock edge. The protocol can be rising or falling edge triggered.
#
What is simplex?
Two devices communicate in one direction only.~Only unidirectional communication is possible (only one side may transmit and the other side can only recieve).
#
What is Half Duplex?
Two devices can communicate in two directions. ~Not simultaneously~Transmit and recieve share the same data line.
#
What is full duplex?
Two devices can communicate simultaneously~There are seperate data lines for transmit and recieve.~This is bidirectional
#
Draw a diagram showing simplex, half and full duplex to illustrate their differences.

#
What is a parity bit?
A single bit that is added to some string of binary code that provides low cost error detection.
#
Regarding I2C, what are the three main features (synchronicity, how data is sent and simplex or duplexity)?
It is:~Half duplex (both ends can send and recieve but not simultaneously)~Serial (bits are sent sequentially one at a time)~ Synchronous (uses a shared clock)
#
What are the two wires of I2C?
SCL is the Serial Clock Line. ~SDA is the Serial Data Line.
#
Draw a diagram of I2C in action with one master and two slaves.

#
How does I2C verify its infomation?
Verification of every byte is built in with an ACK signal protocol after every data word.
#
What does the I2C have pull up/down resistors?
This removes the chance of having a floating or undefined value by creating a default state for the pin.
#
Why does the IC2 interface pin have an open drain collector on both the clock and data pins?
Bus signals will always default to logic high thus they must be activly pulled low for operation.
#
Describe the process of how the master writes to the slave.
1. Both lines are idle (HIGH)|2. Master transmits Start by pulling SDA active LOW.|3. Master transmits the 7 bit slave address. This indicates the slave should listen to the data arriving.|4. Master transmits Write bit. this indicates the master is about to begin transmitting data. |5. The recieving slave transmits an ACK bit. This is done when the recieving slave pulls the SDA active LOW for one bit. All other slaves leave the line high.|6. The master transmits 8 bits of data serially. |7. The recieveing slave transmits an ACK back.|8. Master transmits the STOP command to indicate end of communication. This is done by letting the SDA go high while the SCL is high.
#
How do you know if the I2C communication line is idle?
The SDA and SCL lines are high when idle. To begin transmission and send the START bit, the SDA is pulled active low for one bit. To STOP, the master lets the SDA go high while the SCL is high.
#
Can the slave ever control the SDA line in an I2C communication?
Yes, the Slave controls the SDA line when it sends an ACK bit after recieving a WRITE bit or data. An ACK bit is sent when the slave holds the SDA line Active LOW for one bit.
#
Can the slave ever control the SCL line in an I2C communication?
Yes. The Slace can control the SCL line to change the frequency of transmission. It will do this by holding the SCL LOW for jsdgfsjdguy????????? MUST CHEK THE ANSWR FOR THIS!!!!! WARNING WARNING WARNING
#
Draw the I2C timing diagram for the transmitting the following:| Slave Address = 0b1010020, Data = 0b01011010
