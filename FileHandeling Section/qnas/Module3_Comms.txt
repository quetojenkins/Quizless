#
How do microcontrollers and microporcessors interact with a larger system and an external system?
Through wired or wireless communication interfaces.
#
How does a parallel communication interface work?
Parallel sends multiple bits of data in one go on separate lines.
#
Draw a diagram that illustrates the principle differences between serial and parallel interfaces.

#
What is Endianness?
It is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory.
#
What is the Big Endian?
The MSB of a word is stored at the smallest memory address. Thuis it is sent first in a communication.
#
What is Little Endian?
The MSB is stored at the largest memory address. It is sent last in a communication.
#
What does Asynchronous mean?
The communication does not have a seperate clock to indicate when actions or desicions should occur. This means data can be transmitted intermitently.
#
How would asynchronous communication work?
Both devices agree on how long it takes to transmit a bit.
#
What does Synchronous mean?
A seperate clock signal is ncorporated into the code and is used to indicate when desicions occur. No start or stop bits are required.
#
How does sampling on an edge work?
An action regards a occurs on a clock edge. The protocol can be rising or falling edge triggered.
#
What is simplex?
Two devices communicate in one direction only.~Only unidirectional communication is possible (only one side may transmit and the other side can only recieve).
#
What is Half Duplex?
Two devices can communicate in two directions. ~Not simultaneously~Transmit and recieve share the same data line.
#
What is full duplex?
Two devices can communicate simultaneously~There are seperate data lines for transmit and recieve.~This is bidirectional
#
Draw a diagram showing simplex, half and full duplex to illustrate their differences.

#
What is a parity bit?
A single bit that is added to some string of binary code that provides low cost error detection.
#
Regarding I2C, what are the three main features (synchronicity, how data is sent and simplex or duplexity)?
It is:~Half duplex (both ends can send and recieve but not simultaneously)~Serial (bits are sent sequentially one at a time)~ Synchronous (uses a shared clock)
#
What are the two wires of I2C? Please explain them.
SCL is the Serial Clock Line. ~SDA is the Serial Data Line.
