Where is the question mark from?
When a copyist or scribe was not sure about the word which he was copying, he would write “quaere” next to the word in question. This means “ask” in Latin and it reminded him to ask about it later. Since this occurred frequently, the “quaere” was abbreviated to “qu” or simply “q”. By writing this in one stroke and indicating that it was an abbreviation by following it with a ful-stop. It was then corrupted into the shape ? we use today.
