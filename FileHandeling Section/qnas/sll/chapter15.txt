In order to prevent this from happening he swallowed each one as it was born. ~Finally, when Rhea gave birth to her last son, Zeus, instead of giving Kronos her baby, she deceived him by giving him a stone wrapped in baby clothes to swallow. ~She took Zeus to Crete where he was brought up, unbeknown to his father. When he grew up he challenged and deposed his father. He forced his father to release his brothers and sisters. ~He then married his sister, Hera, and made Mount Olympus the home of the gods and goddesses who became known as the Olympian gods. ~He declared himself king of the gods and made his brother, Poseidon, god of the sea, and Hades, god of the Underworld.
