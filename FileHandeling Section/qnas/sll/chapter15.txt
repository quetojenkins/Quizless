What does the birth of the Gods Say?
~Uranus and Ge had several groups of children, most notably the Titans who were a race of colossal size and strength. ~Uranus was jealous of his children and~ Kronos then married his sister Rhea and they produced many children. ~Kronos knew of a
prophecy that he too would be deposed by one of his sons. In order to prevent this from
happening he swallowed each one as it was born. ~Finally, when Rhea gave birth to her last
son, Zeus, instead of giving Kronos her baby, she deceived him by giving him a stone
wrapped in baby clothes to swallow. ~She took Zeus to Crete where he was brought up,
unbeknown to his father. When he grew up he challenged and deposed his father. He
forced his father to release his brothers and sisters. He then married his sister, Hera, and
made Mount Olympus the home of the gods and goddesses who became known as the
Olympian gods. He declared himself king of the gods and made his brother, Poseidon,
god of the sea, and Hades, god of the Underworld.
