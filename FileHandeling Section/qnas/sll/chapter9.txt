What principle to roman numerals apply?
Roman numerals apply the principle of addition and subtraction, using the bigger symbol as the main number, i.e. X is bigger than V; L is bigger than X; C is bigger than L; D is bigger than C and M is larger than D. Only one number may be subtracted from the next bigger one but up to three can be added.

What does quintessential mean?
The modern meaning of the words, quintessence and quintessential, has nothing to do with the number five which is at the root of the word. It originally referred to the ‘fifth essence’ (ether)- which the ancient philosopher, Aristotle, believed existed in addition to earth, air, fire and water, permeating all things and forming the substance of the heavenly bodies. This was eventually disproved and the meaning which we apply today is ‘the most typical example of something’, ‘the most important thing’ or ‘the purest form of something.
