#
What is the shared memory model?
All memory placed in a single physical address space. There is virtual address space across all memeory.
#
What memory model does java use?
The shared memory model
#
What is a cache?
it is a hardware or software component that stores data so future requests are serviced faster. It is the bridge between the main memory and the processor
#
What is a thread?
process that has been given internal control.
#
How do threads communicate with each other?
Threads communicate implicitly through shared memory. WARNING*** it is important to protect variable correctly. To communicate, a thread must write somewhere another thread will read.
#
How many cores will a program use?
The programmer DOESNT KNOW. You can only make a guess.
#
How many threads will the program use?
DONT KNOW. cant guess
#
What are the two programming models?
Sequential Program state and shared memory state
#
How many program counters and call stacks does the sequential program state have? and how does it work?
It has one program state and one call stack. Each stack frame holds local variables for a method that is running.
#
How does a stack work?
In a stack, there are multiple frames. Each frame holds variables for a method that is running. Calling a method pushes a new frame on to the stack. Returning from a method pops a frame from the stack.
#
How does the call stack and program counter work in the shared memory program model?
Each thread has its own program counter, call stack and local variables. Threads share all objects and static fields.
#
What is asynchrony?
Threads are suceptable to sudden, unpredictable delays. These include cache misses, page faults and scheduling quantum finished.
#
Where does a chache miss occur and waht is it?
A cache miss occurs when the data being requested isnt found in cache memory. This occurs between the shared emmory and the local cache.
#
WHhere does a page fault occur and what is it?
A page fault occurs between the sahred memory and the disk. It is when a program attempts to access data that is in an address space but not currently in RAM.
