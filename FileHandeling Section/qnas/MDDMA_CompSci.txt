#
Why are mobile devices currently so important?
~They are a significant part of the economy ~They shape culture and trends~ Access and lack of access impacts equality and access to resources etc
#
What is user centered design?
User centered design starts and ends with users.
#
What is interaction design?
Interaction Design is the design of spaces for human communication and intersection (with computing devices and with one another)
#
What are some high level goals of a good app design?
~Easy to learn~Effective to use~Enjoyable
#
What are some key performance indicators that your mobile design is successful?
~High user retention~ More clicks and screen time~ More ad views~ Persuasion
#
What is the design cycle?
You start by evaluating what you know about the users – then based on that, come up with a design. Finally, you actually build something. This then starts the next cycle – an evaluation of what you’ve prototyped, analysis of the findings, resulting in a new design, followed by building the prototype. This continues as long as you have time until everyone is satisfied with the final product.
#
What is Human Computer Interaction (HCI)?
fffff
#
When is it User Error and when is it Designer Error?
Sfff
#
How to prevent the user form making errors through good design?
Make infrequent things harder to do~ allow for undo and help prevent errors.
#
What are the 8 Golden Rules of Design?
1. Strive for consistency|2. Cater to Universal Usability|3. Offer informative Feedback|4. Create Closure|5. Prevent Errors|6. Reverse actions|7. Provide control|8. Reduce short term memory load
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Strive for Consistency".
~Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations,~ use the same terminoloogy,~consistent colour scheme and layout
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Seek universal usability"?
~Recognize the needs of diverse users,~make sure anyone can use it~dont rely on cultural or demographic knowledge and habits to make it functional etc
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Offer Informative Feedback"?
~ For every user action there should be an interface feedback action. This makes the app feel alive and responsive.~ It may also help guide the user and helps the user understand the consequences of their actions. ~It also provides feedback and helps prevent errors by indicating a user is about to make a mistake~ reinforces a sense of control
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Design dialogs to yield closure"?
Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. ~ informative feed back gives users a sense of completion and satisfaction.
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Prevent Errors"?
design the interface so that users cannot make serious errors~ , the interface should offer simple, constructive, and specific instructions for recovery.
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Permit easy reversal of actions"?
As much as possible, actions should be reversible.~this reduces user anxiety~encourages user exploration and engagement
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Keep users in Control"?
Experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the interface and that the interface responds to their actions.~ Dont introduce surprises or changes in familiar patterns
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Reduce Short Term Memory Load"?
avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one display and then use that information on another display
#
What are guidelines?
Guidelines are vague and the user needs to have a theoretical understanding.~ Tend to be generalisations
#
What are standards?
Very specific criteria to meet~Set by an international committe
#
Tabulate the differences between Standards and Guidelines.

#
What are affordances?
Affordances are the potential actions and interactions that the environment offers
#
What are Percieved Affordances?
Perceived affordances of an object are those properties of the object which give users clues as to how the device is used
#
What are Hidden Affordances?
fffff
#
Give Two examples of Visual Affordance Problems?
The bar looks like it scrolls by actually dksfeiur
#
What is Mapping?
ensure a natural correlation between objects and the interface controlling them| There should be a direct relationship between an artefact and the interface controlling it
#
What is a Skeuomorph?
When a derivative object retains ornamental design cues that were necessary or essential to the original| Calculator app looks like a Calculator
#
What are constraints?
limitations put on a design so that it can only be used the correct way. ~ may help a user enter data correctly and understand how to use something so they cant break it
#
What are transfer effects?
People transfer expectations from known objects to similar new ones. For example, you expect a keyboard to be in look like a keyboard which is based on old type writers.
#
WHat is a learned affordance?
To open a door with a knob you twist right
#
What are cultural dependencies?
Is a traffic light yellow or black, round or swuare?
#
What are the Ten Usability Heuristics?
1. Visibility of System Status|2. User Control and Freedom|3. Aesthertic and Minimal Design|4. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use|5. Help and Documenttion|6. Match between system and real world|7. Error Prevention|8. Consistency and Standards |9. Recofnition over Recall |10. Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from erros.
#
What does Recognition over Recall mean?
pg 4 of Design Principles
