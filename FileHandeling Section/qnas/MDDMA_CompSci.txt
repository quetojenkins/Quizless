#
What are some key performance indicators that your mobile design is successful?
~High user retention~ More clicks and screen time~ More ad views~ Persuasion
#
What is the design cycle?
You start by evaluating what you know about the users – then based on that, come up with a design. Finally, you actually build something. This then starts the next cycle – an evaluation of what you’ve prototyped, analysis of the findings, resulting in a new design, followed by building the prototype. This continues as long as you have time until everyone is satisfied with the final product.

What are the 8 Golden Rules of Design?
1. Strive for consistency|2. Cater to Universal Usability|3. Offer informative Feedback|4. Create Closure|5. Prevent Errors|6. Reverse actions|7. Provide control|8. Reduce short term memory load
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Strive for Consistency".
~Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations,~ use the same terminoloogy,~consistent colour scheme and layout
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Seek universal usability"?
~Recognize the needs of diverse users,~make sure anyone can use it~dont rely on cultural or demographic knowledge and habits to make it functional etc
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Offer Informative Feedback"?
~ For every user action there should be an interface feedback action. This makes the app feel alive and responsive.~ It may also help guide the user and helps the user understand the consequences of their actions. ~It also provides feedback and helps prevent errors by indicating a user is about to make a mistake~ reinforces a sense of control
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Design dialogs to yield closure"?
Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle, and end. ~ informative feed back gives users a sense of completion and satisfaction.
#
Explain how in the 8 Golden Rules of Design, it must "Prevent Errors"?
design the interface so that users cannot make serious errors~ , the interface should offer simple, constructive, and specific instructions for recovery.
