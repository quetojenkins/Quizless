Write an appropriate function body for the C function in ARM Assembly; as this is a very simple program, you do not need to perform any load/store operations with the stack. (7)

#
Write an appropriate function epilogue for the C function in ARM Assembly (2)
since r0 already has the return value – either r2 or the value 1 (if the Greater branch was taken) – the epilogue only needs to do the "return" to the calling function: ||ldmea fp, {fp, sp, pc}

Suppose that we are working with a successive approximation-based 4-bit ADC. The input voltage range extends from Vmin = 1 V (="0000") to Vmax = 5 V (="1111"). Which two steps are used to convert the input voltage to a corresponding digital output signal? You may use pseudocode to explain your answer. (4)
