What is an Embedded system?
An embedded systems are infomation processing systems embedded within a larger product. Time and concurrency management are important.
#
What is a real time system?
An event driven system that is reactive to inputs or events and produces a predictable output.
#
What are key characterisitcs of a RT system?
Event driven, continous operation, tolerant, predictable behaviour.
#
What are the four cases of RT?
Hard, soft, real and firm RT
#
What is Hard RT?
A hard real time system is one in which it is absolutly imperative that the response occurs within the required deadline. Eg a flight contorl sysyem
#
What is Soft RT
A system where deadlines of responses are important but will still function if the occasional deadline is missed. Create more on TASK optimisation and not TIMING optisimatsion.
#
What is Real RT
Systems that have at least one hard RT system with a very short response time
#
What is firm RT
It is a system that can survive task faliures if deadlines are missed as long as they occur far apart.
#
What
#
What is a STATIC RT system?
Task times are finely predicted. Static analysis is possible.
#
What is a DYNAMIC RT?
Arrival times of tasks may be unpredictable.
#
What is periodic design?
Each task executes repeatedly at specific periods. And well suited to hard RT.
#
What is aperiodic or asynchrnouns design?
An aperiodic, or ‘sporadic’, system is designed around being reactive.
#
Tabulate the differences between hard real time and soft realtime.

#
What is a saftey critical system?
A system where faliure could result in death or injury to people or sevre damage to environments.
#
What are the three types of resource availability? And what are they?
Abundance of rescources: all computing and timing constraints easily met. \n Totally inadequate resources: major short fall. Simplifies design. Sufficient but scarce resources: makes probelems harder.
#
What is a “Dynamic Synchronous Hard Real-time System?”
It is a system that has unpredictable task arrival times but executes at a specific period. The implemntation is strict and timings are presicely adhered to.
#
I have a system comprises two computers, the one a hard RTS and the other a soft RTS, what is the whole system called then?
A hard RTS.
#
What is the internet of things?
the billions of physical embedded devices around the world that are connected to the internet, all collecting and delivering data.
#
Why has there been an explosion of IoT devies?
This is possible from super cheap computer chips and ubiquity of wireless networks… together making it possible to turn (almost) anything into a part of the IoT.
#
What is a design metric?
a measurable feature of an embedded system’s design, e.g. its performance, cost, time for implementation, safety, etc.
#
What is the development environment?
the environment where development occurs
#
What does the development envionement include?
Equipment used for development, ~ tools uised for development (compilers, linkers etc) and ~ other resources such as manuals and datasheets.
#
What are the benefits of the PC development environment?
The environment is well defined ~ The toolchain is fully configured ~ Debugging is easy with an IDE~ there are libraries
#
What are the issues with the embedded development environment?
Tools depend on the software vendor, the hardware vendor and the peripherals used~ the tootchain must be built from scratch ~few libraries availbale
#
Why is C so great?
It is simple,~ flexible~ portable~ just enough abstraction~ just high level enough to make it friendly
